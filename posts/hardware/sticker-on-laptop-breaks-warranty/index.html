    <h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>A sticker on your laptop is &lsquo;damage&rsquo; and breaks your warranty</li>
<li>Well, according to eBuyer&hellip;</li>
<li>Reading their linkedIn page: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ebuyer/">&lsquo;We pride ourselves on our customer service&rsquo;</a>
<ul>
<li>I would beg to differ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>eBuyer has refused to honour the Consumer Rights Act 2015 claiming that a sticker on a laptop voids their obligations under the act.</li>
<li>They claim that a sticker invalidates the warranty, yet refuse to produce the warranty, let alone show where in the warranty it states that a sticker on a laptop is &lsquo;damage&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real damage:

</p></p>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li>2021 June 2: purchased laptop from eBuyer</li>
<li>2021 June 29: returned with a <strong>key broken off the keyboard</strong></li>
<li>2021 July 14: return was rejected. ‘I am afraid as the laptop has come back with stickers and red pen on it this voids the warranty which comes with the laptop’</li>
</ul>
<p>What eBuyer thinks is damage:

<ul>
<li>eBuyer: I am afraid as the laptop has come back with stickers and red pen on it this voids the warranty which comes with the laptop</li>
<li>Me: Can you supply me with the warranty that you mention</li>
<li>eBuyer: Unfortunately, we do not have copies of the warranty that I can send you I am afraid.</li>
<li>Me: How can I verify your claim of the warranty being invalidated if I cannot see the warranty ?
Could you take a picture of it ?</li>
<li>eBuyer: As said previously we do not have a copy of the warranty I am afraid.
As the laptop has been <strong>damaged</strong> by the customer this voids the warranty I am afraid.</li>
<li>Me: Can I ask a few questions for clarification:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Do you count the stickers as damage ?</li>
<li>Do you count the red pen mark as damage ?</li>
<li>Is there a definition of damage that you use to decide whether an item is damaged ?</li>
<li>Is there a definition of damaged that you are applying with regards to the consumer rights act? eg
what definition does the act specify</li>
<li>If you/eBuyer does not have a copy of the warranty, how do you know that the &lsquo;damage&rsquo; invalidates
the warranty ?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>eBuyer: I cannot advise you of anything further.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="follow-up">Follow up</h3>
<p>I followed up with:</p>
<p>Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you are under an implied obligation to supply goods that are of satisfactory quality and that are fit for purpose. Clearly, a laptop with a defective keyboard is not of satisfactory quality or fit for purpose. You are in breach of contract by failing to supply a product of satisfactory quality and I am entitled to a remedy. There is no basis for arguing that some stickers on the laptop's cover deprive me of my statutory right to reject a laptop with a defective keyboard.</p>
<p>I wish to refer you to the guidance on the CRA 2015 published by the Department for Business Innovations &amp; Skills (BEIS) which states that in relation to the requirement of satisfactory quality, goods sold by a business must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are usually supplied.</li>
<li>Free from minor defects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To date, I have had no response&hellip;</strong></p>
<h3 id="moving-on">Moving on</h3>
<ul>
<li>eBuyer has lost a customer</li>
<li>It is interesting to think about &lsquo;what is damage&rsquo;; a scratch on the screen, a sticker, a smudge.</li>
<li>I will update this post in due course&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-others-say">What others say</h3>
<p>I am obviously not alone in feeling mistreated by eBuyer:</p>
